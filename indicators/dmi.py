    Calculates Directional Movement Index (DMI)
    Gives: +DI, -DI and ADX

    +DM = today's high - yesterday's high if it's greater than the drop
    -DM = yesterday's low - today's low if it's greater than the rise
    TR  = True Range (max of high-low, high-prev_close, low-prev_close)

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): OHLC data
        period (int): Lookback window for smoothing

    Returns:
        dict of pd.Series: +DI, -DI, ADX

    Example:
        +DI > -DI and ADX > 20 â†’ uptrend confirmed â†’ trade allowed
        +DI < -DI â†’ downtrend, potential short


    ðŸ§® How DMI Works (Step-by-Step)

        1. Calculate True Range (TR):
            TR = max(
                current_high - current_low,
                abs(current_high - previous_close),
                abs(current_low - previous_close)
            )
        
        2. Calculate +DM and âˆ’DM (Directional Movements):
            +DM = current_high - previous_high  (only if it's greater than downward move and > 0)
            -DM = previous_low - current_low   (only if it's greater than upward move and > 0)
            Smooth TR, +DM, and âˆ’DM using Wilderâ€™s method over a period (e.g., 14 candles).
        
        3. Calculate +DI and âˆ’DI:
            +DI = 100 * (Smoothed +DM / Smoothed TR)
            -DI = 100 * (Smoothed -DM / Smoothed TR)

        4. Calculate ADX (Trend Strength Indicator):
            DX = 100 * abs(+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI)
            ADX = EMA of DX over N periods (commonly 14)

    
    ðŸ“Š Interpretation

        Scenario	Meaning
        +DI > âˆ’DI	Uptrend (Buy signal if other indicators agree)
        âˆ’DI > +DI	Downtrend (Short/Sell signal if others agree)
        ADX > 20â€“25	Trend is strong (regardless of direction)
        ADX < 20	Market is range-bound / sideways
